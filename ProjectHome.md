# PER-MARE - extending map-reduce to pervasive and desktop grids #

Our project aims at proposing scalable techniques to support existent Map-Reduce-based, data-intensive applications, but in the context of loosely coupled networks such as pervasive and desktop grids. While the emergence of cloud infrastructures has opened new perspectives, several enterprises hesitate to put sensible data on the cloud and prefer to rely on free unused internal resources (using the desktop grid model) to develop their applications. By relying on a programming model such as Map-Reduce, we can intend to explore the potential advantages of using such infrastructures alone or in an hybrid environment.

Our approach to improve the behavior of Map-Reduce based applications on pervasive grids and desktop grids uses a two-fold investigation method. Hence, to better understand the elements that may impact the deployment of Map-Reduce over pervasive grids, our teams will investigate the problem through two different approaches:

  * by modifying Hadoop as to implement automatic tuning of the nodes, simplifying therefore the deployment procedure.

  * by adapting a distributed computing platform to make it compatible with the Map-Reduce paradigm and, more specifically, with Hadoop's API.

We believe that this double approach is essential to understand and cover all the facets of the problem. By comparing these two approaches "side by side" we can propose effective solutions for pervasive and desktop grids.

In order to validate our developments, we target a scalable execution across multiple sites with real-life workloads from existing applications. A distributed desktop grid among our institutions shall provide important insights on the adaptability to the heterogeneity of resources and the dynamicity of the networks. In addition, the Grid’5000 platform will provide the additional experimental infrastructure to explore the scalability issues of our work.
